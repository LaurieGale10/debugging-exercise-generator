    Novices commonly incorrectly indent their code, so I can indent the line to introduce a syntax error. I can also mismatch the quotes and braces, as these are common syntactical mistakes made by novices.

    <incorrect-program>
    Print("Hello world'}
    </incorrect-program>

    I incorrectly indented line 1 to add a syntax error, as well as converting the closing quotation mark and bracket to mismatch with the opening ones, each in turn adding another syntax error.
