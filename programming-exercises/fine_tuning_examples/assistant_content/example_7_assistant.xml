    There are lots of small syntactical errors that novices usually make when programming, including forgetting to include single character symbols when necessary. I could therefore remove some brackets and the colon from the if statement to introduce some syntax errors.

    <incorrect-program>
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    
    # Check if the user is old enough to vote
    if age => 18
        print("You are old enough to vote!")
    else:
        print "You are not old enough to vote yet."
    </incorrect-program>

    I added two syntax errors to line 4; I changed the inequality in the if statement condition to be => instead of >=, which is syntactically incorrect, and removed the colon from the end of the if statement.
    I removed the brackets from the call to the print function in line 7.
