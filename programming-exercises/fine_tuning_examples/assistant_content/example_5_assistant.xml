    Indentation is something that novices commonly get wrong, so I can remove some necessary indentation in the if statement. To add runtime errors, I can change the = in the first assignment to be a comparison (==). I can also change one of the references to the age variable. Iâ€™ll add a logical error by changing the comparison in the if statement, so that it incorrectly states anyone over 18 is allowed to vote (rather than 18 or over).

    <incorrect-program>
    age == int(input("Enter your age: "))
    
    # Check if the user is old enough to vote
    if Age > 18:
        print("You are old enough to vote!")
    else:
    print("You are not old enough to vote yet.")
    </incorrect-program>

    Runtime error on line 1 due to == being used in assignment instead of =
    I added a runtime error on line 4 by changing the age variable reference to a non-existent age_input, as well as adding a logical adding by replacing the >= with just a >.
    I removed the necessary indentation to line 7 after the else condition which results in an additional syntax error.
