    It is very difficult to add 10 errors to a such a short program, so Iâ€™ll add 3, as this seems like the near-maximum number of errors that can be added without significantly changing the program.
    Novice programmers usually mismatch brackets and symbols, especially when formatting print statements, so a few errors can be introduced by these means. The print statement can also be capitalised to introduce another syntax error.

    <incorrect-program>
    Print "Hello world''
    </incorrect-program>
    
    <error-location>
    1
    1
    1
    </error-location>

    It is very difficult to add all 10 errors to the program without significantly changing its content, so only 3 syntax errors were added to this example.
    Capitalised the call to the print function .
    Removed the brackets from the call to the print() function.
    Mismatched the quotation marks to the print statement.
