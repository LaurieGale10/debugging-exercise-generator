    There are lots of errors to add here, so let's break them down by error type.
    Firstly, to add syntax errors, I know novices often struggle with correctly indenting in Python. I can therefore unindent both the clauses of the if statement, which introduces two syntax errors. Novice programmers also often mismatch quotation marks in their output statements, so I can edit some of the quotation marks to the program.
    To add runtime errors, novices sometimes erroneously capitalise variable references, so I do this. I could also add a type error (a type of runtime error in Python) by introducing an erroneous int() cast.
    To add logical errors, I could remove the input() function so that no user input is taken, violating a part of the program description. I could also change one of the print statements to output a faulty message e.g "Correct" instead of "incorrect".

    <incorrect-program>
    user_answer == "What is the capital of Hungary? "
    
    # Display the user's answer
    print("You answered: {User_Answer}")
    
    # Check if the answer is correct and display the appropriate message
    if int(user_answer) != "budapest":
    print("Correct!")
    else:
    print("Correct!'')
    
    </incorrect-program>

    Line 1: Replaced the assignment operator (=) with the equality operator (==), introducing a runtime error in Python. Also removed the input() function call so that the user_answer would be illogically assigned to "What is the capital of Hungary" rather than the user's input.
    Line 4: Capitalised the reference to the user_answer variable, introducing a runtime error.
    Line 7: Introduced a type error by adding an int case to the user_answer variable, and incorrectly changed the equality operator (==) to inequality 9!=) operator.
    Unindented lines 8 and 10, introducing two separate syntax errors.
    Line 10: Incorrectly adjusted quotation marks in print statement so that they don't match, as well as changed the output text to be "Correct!" instead of "Incorrect", which is logically incorrect.
