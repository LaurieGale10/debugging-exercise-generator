    There's not much scope to add a logical error in such a small program, but printing an incorrect output may cause test cases to fail, which constitutes a logical error. I could change what's outputted in the print function.

    <incorrect-program>
    print("hi lovely world")
    </incorrect-program>
    
    <error-location>

    </error-location>

    I changed the print statement's parameter to be "hi lovely world" instead of "Hello world". As a result, the program does not output what is specified and hence introduces a logical error.
