    Novices often get assignment (=) and equality (==) operators confused, so I could introduce a runtime by replacing an assignment with a comparison operator.
    Novices also forget to always use quotes, so I could remove the quotes from the Budapest in the if statement condition which will introduce a NameError in Python (a type of runtime error).

    <incorrect-program>
    user_answer == input("What is the capital of Hungary? ")
    
    # Display the user's answer
    print(f"You answered: {user_answer}")
    
    # Check if the answer is correct and display the appropriate message
    if user_answer.strip().lower() == budapest:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect. The correct answer is Budapest.")

    Replaced the assignment operator (=) with an equality operator (==).
    Removed the quotes surrounding “Budapest” in the if statement condition, introducing a NameError in Python.
