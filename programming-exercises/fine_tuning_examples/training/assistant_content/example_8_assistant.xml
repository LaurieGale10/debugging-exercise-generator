    In Python, type errors and name errors can be constituted as runtime errors, so I could add some of these. Novices sometimes incorrectly capitalise variable names, so I could change one of the references to inputInteger. Novices often forget to incorrectly type variables in python, so I could also remove the int() cast when reading in a value from the input, as this will cause a type error later on in the program. To add the remaining runtime error, I could change one of the assignments to include a == instead of =.

    <incorrect-program>
    # Input expression
    print('Input an integer')
    inputInteger = input()
    
    # Make calculation (simple if)
    if (InputInteger<50) :
       inputInteger += 10
    inputInteger == inputInteger**4.0
    
    # Output
    print("Result is:", inputInteger)
    </incorrect-program>

    Removed the int() cast for the inputInteger variable on line 3, which adds a type error (an instance of runtime error in Python).
    Incorrectly renamed one of the references to the inputInteger variable on line 6 to InputInteger, which adds a NameError (runtime error)
    Replaced the = assignment in line 8 with == to introduce another NameError (runtime error).
